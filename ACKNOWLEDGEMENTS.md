### Numpy

Numpy is an extremely powerful and arguably the most popular Python package fundamental to scientific computing and is known for its extreme processing power and capabilities. Its functions range from simple numerical calculations, to image modification through pixel arrays, to even this repository!

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is an expansive library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, plots, and graphs in Python. Applications of matplotlib include Python scripts, shells, web applications, and even GUIs.

Matplotlib currently does not have a license, meaning it is *not* free-to-edit.
